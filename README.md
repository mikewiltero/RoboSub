# TALON
**code in this repository is either defunct or waiting to be converted to be used in ROS. When converted, it will be merged into the main repo**

Welcome to the fun times at RoboSub! Visit us at [unfauv.org](http://unfauv.org)

Pull requests welcome! (Message me if you are not comfortable with git)

**If you do not submit code through github, we have no way to credit you for it**

## Current Proposed technology Stack

- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) with [firmatta](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Firmata) using [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five)

- Computer vision happens with existing python code

## Getting started

- Please visit the Johnny-Five link above, and go through the blink-led tutorials. There are plenty.
- Play around with circuits with [123d.circuits.io](https://123d.circuits.io/lab)

- Join us on Slack! Message for an invite.

## Future plans

- Calibration based software for the following:
  - vision
  - thrusters
  - stabilization
  - PID
- Need to improve vision detection software. Resources available in software/electrical slack channels
- Currently have some proof of concept code for stabilization code


## Installing Dependencies 

 - Prior to installing depedencies for running the code it is recommended that your OS is updated. 
 
 #### Ubuntu Linux 14.04 

  - Ensure that your system is up to date by entering the following commands in terminal: 

    `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`

  - To install the dependencies required for OpenCV, just run the following commands:
	  
	  ```
      sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff4-dev libjasper-dev libopenexr-dev cmake  python-dev    
	  python-numpy python-tk libtbb-dev libeigen3-dev yasm libfaac-dev libopencore-amrnb-dev                        
	  libopencore-amrwb-dev libtheora-dev    libvorbis-dev   libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl-dev              
	  sphinx-common texlive-latex-extra libv4l-dev    libdc1394-22-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev    
	  default-jdk ant libvtk5-qt4-dev
	  ```

  - You can download manually or run the commands below to get OpenCV
    
	  ```
	  cd ~                                                                                                                        
	  wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.4.9/opencv-2.4.9.zip                                  
	  unzip opencv-2.4.9.zip                                                                                                       
	  cd opencv-2.4.9
	  ```

  - Now we have to generate the Makefile by using cmake
     
	  ```
      mkdir build cd build cmake -D WITH_TBB=ON -D BUILD_NEW_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON -D WITH_V4L=ON -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON -D         
	  INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON  -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -D WITH_QT=ON -D WITH_OPENGL=ON -D WITH_VTK=ON .. 
	  ```

  - Now, you are ready to compile and install OpenCV 2.4.9:
     `make sudo make install`
	
 #### Windows  

  1. Ensure that system is up to date prior to installing software: 
  
  2. Download and install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7.2). You need to install the 32 bit version of Python. Opencv currently doesn't work with the 64 bit version 
  
  3. Install [Numpy](http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.6.1/numpy-1.6.1-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe/download).  Numpy is an extension to the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. 
  
  4. Install [Scipy](http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/0.9.0/scipy-0.9.0-win32-superpack-python2.7.exe/download).  SciPy is a scientific computing library for python.
  
  5. Download [Opencv](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.4.11/opencv-2.4.11.exe/download) 
		
		1. The exe will extract opencv. Exact to C:/
		2. copy the content of C:/opencv/build/python2.7 to C:/Python27/Lib/site-packages
		
  6. Add "C:/Python2.7;C:/OpenCV2.2/bin" to PATH variable
		
		1. Hold Win and press Pause.
		2. Click Advanced System Settings.
		3. Click Environment Variables.
		4. Append ;C:\python27;C:/OpenCV2.2/bin; to the Path variable.
		
## Running the current code
   
   1. Download zip file containing [code](https://github.com/OspreyRobotics/RoboSub/archive/master.zip)
   2. Unzip file 
   3. Go to cameraTrackingAPI folder and delete cv2.so file (Note the cv2.so is a compiled code that was generated on a Raspiberry PI. Code will not work unless these file are generated again)
   4. Delete the cv2.so file in cameraTrackingAPI/ospery_diver folder
   5. Run the code:
		1. The driver program, colorDetector.py is located in the cameraTrackingAPI
		2. To run the progam:
		
		C:\Users\Coder\Documents\RoboSub\cameraTrackingAPI>python colorDetector.py
